Son Goten and his friend Trunks search for a gift for Videl, soon to be his sister-in-law when his older brother, Son Gohan, is engaged to her. First, they decide on rings, then they decide on make-up, but unable to afford any, head for the hot springs in the woods to bottle some mineral water instead. While there, they are attacked by a giant snake, which they manage to scare away. For his purported role in saving Earth from Majin Boo, Mr. Satan has been awarded with 100 million Zeni that he does not want. He decides to give the money to one of the fighters; namely Goku. Goku gives the money to Chi-Chi, so she would let him train. Meanwhile, somewhere in the depths of space, Beerus, the God of Destruction, has awakened from his slumber. Keen on battling the worthy opponent that appeared to him in his visions, Beerus and his attendant Whis set out to discover who this opponent is. </td>

Somewhere in space, Beerus and Whis scour an alien planet in search of dinosaur meat. They are confronted by the planet's strongest dweller, but he proves to be no match for them.

They soon learn of Son Goku and his feats and decide to pay him and Kaiō-sama a visit.

She invites Beerus and Whis to join the party. Beerus gladly accepts her offer and enjoys the food available.

Whis soon learns of pudding, which he finds to be extraordinary delicious; so much so that he urges Beerus to have some too.

Piccolo, Tenshinhan, and Android 18 try taking on Beerus with little success. Majin Boo attacks again but is unable to land a single hit. While observing the battle, Dende realizes what Beerus actually is and immediately informs Piccolo. Before Piccolo is able to warn him, Gohan powers up and charges towards Beerus. Using Majin Boo as a weapon, Beerus repels Gohan, taking them both out. Being the last one standing, Vegeta confronts Beerus, but he is swiftly brought to the ground. Beerus tells Vegeta that he is disappointed with him; that he is just as weak as his father was. Just as Beerus is about to finish Vegeta, Bulma walks up and slaps him for ruining her party.

Meanwhile, fearing for their lives, Pilaf Gang disembark Bulma's ship on a rowboat and sail away.

In space, Goku struggles to keep up with Beerus' attack, which ultimately ends up in a massive explosion, blinding everyone on Earth. Shortly after, the light clears out, revealing everything to be as it was prior to the explosion. Beerus explains that he used his full power to negate the explosion, thereby saving the universe. Seeing it as a perfect opportunity to boast, Mr. Satan arranges to have him be falsely credited with saving the planet yet again. Despite being at his limit, Goku remains calm, which annoys the God of Destruction. Beerus thinks Goku might have a strategy that he has been hiding which Goku promptly denies, saying that everything he had been doing was improvised as they fought. The Gods quickly power up and continue fighting, but this time, both at their limit. As soon as they start, Goku loses his Super Saiyan God aura and reverts to the ordinary Super Saiyan form. Upon noticing that, Beerus decides to quit, thinking it is pointless to fight an ordinary Saiyan. Goku, however, does not notice and keeps going at it. Able to sense Goku's energy, Whis assumes that the battle has concluded and that Goku lost, but Piccolo begs to differ. Surprised that Goku is still able to hit him even after losing his God form, Beerus surmises that Goku's body has adjusted to the Super Saiyan God power, making him stronger in his ordinary form. Goku proclaims that, with or without the Super Saiyan God form, it is still him that Beerus is up against, and the two resume their battle. </td>
