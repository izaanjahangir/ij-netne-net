				<p style="margin-left:50px;"><em>Not to be confused with <mark>Super Dragon Ball Z</mark>(It's a Video game)</em></p>

				<p>Dragon Ball Super (Japanese: ドラゴンボール超 Hepburn: Doragon Bōru Sūpā?) is an ongoing Japanese anime television series produced by Toei Animation that began airing on July 5, 2015. It is a sequel show to the Dragon Ball manga and the Dragon Ball Z television series featuring the first new storyline in 18 years. It is set after the defeat of Majin Boo when Earth has become peaceful once again. It is broadcasted on Sundays at 9:00 am on Fuji TV.</p>

				<h3>Plot</h3>
				<p>After the defeat of Majin Boo, peace has returned to Earth. Son Goku has settled down and now works as a radish farmer to support his family. His family and friends live peaceful lives.However, a new threat appears in the form of Beerus, The God of Destruction (破壊神ビルス Hakaishin Birusu) who is considered to be the most terrifying being in the entire universe. Beerus is eager to fight the legendary warrior whom he had seen in a prophecy, known as the Super Saiyan God (超サイヤ人ゴッド Sūpā Saiya-jin Goddo).
				<br/><br/>
				The series retells the events from the last two Dragon Ball Z films, Battle of Gods and Resurrection 'F', before proceeding to tell original stories about the exploration of other universes and the reemergence of Future Trunks and a new threat to his timeline known as Goku Black (ゴクウブラック Gokū Burakku) and a Kaiō-shin from Universe 10 named Zamasu.</p>

				<h3>Production</h3>
				<p>In addition to his role as series creator, Akira Toriyama is also credited for the "original story and character design concepts" of the new anime originally directed by Kimitoshi Chioka. Toriyama elaborated on his involvement with the "Future Trunks arc" saying he created the story based on suggestions from the editorial department, "As with last time, I wrote the overall plot outline, and the scriptwriters have been compiling and expanded the story content into individual episodes, making various changes and additions, and generally doing their best to make the story more interesting." Toei Animation producer Atsushi Kido previously worked on Dragon Ball Z for a brief time during the Freeza arc, while Fuji TV producer Osamu Nozaki said he has been a fan of the series since childhood. Morio Hatano, series director of Saint Seiya Omega (episodes #1-51), began sharing the series director credit with Chioka beginning with episode #33, before taking it over completely with #47.

				Masako Nozawa reprises her roles as Son Goku, Son Gohan, and Son Goten. Most of the original cast reprise their roles as well.[5][8] However, Jōji Yanami's roles as Kaiō-sama and the narrator were indefinitely taken over by Naoki Tatsuta as of episode 12, so that Yanami could take medical leave.Kōichi Yamadera and Masakazu Morita also return as Beerus and Whis, respectively.

				The first preview of the series aired on June 14, 2015, following episode 157 of Dragon Ball Kai. The next day, the main promotional image for Dragon Ball Super was added to its official website and unveiled two new characters, who were later revealed to be named Champa (シャンパ Shanpa) and Vados (ヴァドス), respectively. A thirty-second trailer including the new characters was uploaded to the series' official website on June 26, 2015.

				Dragon Ball Super will receive an English-language dub that will premiere on the Toonami channel in Southeast Asia and India in 2016.</p>
				
				<h3>Music</h3>
				<p>Norihito Sumitomo, the composer for Battle of Gods and Resurrection 'F', is scoring Dragon Ball Super. An original soundtrack for the anime was released on CD by Nippon Columbia on February 24, 2016.

				<br/><br/>

				The opening theme song is "Chōzetsu☆Dynamic!" (超絶☆ダイナミック！ Chōzetsu Dainamikku, "Excellent Dynamic!") by Kazuya Yoshii of The Yellow Monkey. The lyrics were penned by Yukinojo Mori who has written numerous songs for the Dragon Ball series.[18] The first ending theme song for episodes 1 to 12 is "Hello Hello Hello" (ハローハローハロー Harō Harō Harō) by Japanese rock band Good Morning America. The second ending theme song for episodes 13 to 25 is "Starring Star" (スターリングスター Sutāringu Sutā) by the group Key Talk. The third ending song for episodes 26 to 36 is "Usubeni" (薄紅, "Light Pink") by the band Lacco Tower. The fourth ending theme song for episodes 37 to 49 is "Forever Dreaming" by Czecho No Republic. The fifth ending theme song for episodes 50 to 59 is "Yokayoka Dance" (よかよかダンス Yokayoka Dansu, "It's Fine Dance") by idol group Batten Shōjo-tai. The sixth ending theme from episode 60 onwards is "Chao Han Music" (炒飯MUSIC Chāhan Myūjikku) by Arukara.</p>

				<h3>Related Media</h3>
				<p>The Dragon Ball Super anime is being adapted into a companion manga illustrated by artist Toyotarou, who was previously responsible for the official Resurrection 'F' manga adaptation. It began serialization in the August 2015 issue of V Jump, which was released on June 20, 2015. Shueisha began collecting the chapters into tankōbon volumes with the first published on April 4, 2016.[25] Viz Media began posting free English translations of the manga chapters to their website on June 24, 2016.[26] There are plans for a print release in spring 2017.
				<br/><br/>
				The anime episodes are being released on Japanese DVD and Blu-ray sets that contain twelve episodes each. The first set was released on December 2, 2015. The second set was released on March 2, 2016. The third set was released on July 2, 2016. The fourth set was released on October 4, 2016.
				<br/><br/>
				Bandai has announced that a line of Dragon Ball Super toys will be available in the United States in summer 2017.</p>

				<h3>Reception</h3>
				<p>First impressions of the series' debut episode were mostly positive with the quality of animation being praised the most. Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku praised the series' title sequence and said "My middle-school self is so happy right now, you guys."  Jamieson Cox of The Verge also praised the title sequence and said that "Dragon Ball Super's intro will have you begging for its North American release". Cox was also surprised that, considering how popular the franchise is, the series did not launch internationally at the same time. He called it "a move that wouldn't be unprecedented" giving Sailor Moon Crystal as an example. Lucas Siegel of Comicbook.com praised the debut episode for its "laid back plotline" and animation style and said that the debut was "very much put out as a "slice of life" episode". Siegel also noted that the premiere episode was more of a "where are they now" introduction to the series that will eventually help build anticipation for "where will they be."
				<br/><br/>
				However, the fifth episode received harsh criticism from Japanese and Western audiences due to its poor animation style compared to the previous four episodes. Dragon Ball Kai and Resurrection 'F' producer Norihiro Hayashida felt that the criticism was overblown. He said that people were criticizing the entire series based on a few bad sequences that were done by new animators. He went on to explain a quality decline in the anime industry that he believes is the result of studios cutting time given for post-production and not allowing for reviews of the final product. Toei Animation has improved the animation for episode five's Blu-ray and DVD release.
				<br/><br/>
				The twenty-fourth episode of the series also received harsh criticism from both Japanese and western audiences due to its poor animation style, which continued throughout several episodes compared to its previous episodes. However, the Champa Arc was praised for improving its animation. Episode 39 of the series was critically acclaimed for its improved animation and praised fighting sequences. Attack of the Fanboy reported that "Dragon Ball Super" episode 39 may be the best installment of the series to date. Goku and Hit's fight "starts off explosively from the get-go."
				<br/><br/>
				The ongoing Future Trunks Arc has been acclaimed for drastic improvements to animation. Don Don Navidad of the online newspaper website, University Herald, was quoted, "With more deaths and upgrades coming to the "Dragon Ball Super" characters, the story is causing great enthusiasm and fun to watch."</p>
